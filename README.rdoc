= Stemmify

== Description
This is a Rails gem for reducing words to their roots. For example, all the
following words to are stemmed to "observ", which is not a real word
in this case:
	observance
	observances
	observancy
	observant
	observants
	observation
	observe
	observed
	observer
	observers
	observing
	observingly

The algorithm used here is based on the Porter stemmer.
You can read more about Martin Porter's stemmer at 

http://tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer/

Martin Porter explains:

	The Porter stemming algorithm (or ‘Porter stemmer’) is a process for removing
	the commoner morphological and inflexional endings from words in English. Its
	main use is as part of a term normalisation process that is usually done when
	setting up Information Retrieval systems.

== Install

  $ sudo gem install stemmify
or
  $ gem install stemmify

Note that while the source code is hosted on {github}[https://github.com/raypereda/stemmify],
the actual gem is hosted on {RubyGem.org}[https://rubygems.org/gems/stemmify].

== Usage

Let's say you are building some sort of search tool. You want
searches for "observations" and "observer" to all bring up
the same items. When you are building you index, you can
map all the words to their roots using the stem method.

Here's an example usage:
	
  require 'stemmify'
  print("observations".stem) # ==> "observ"

You can use <tt>stemmify</tt> as a command line tool:
  $ stem input_file.txt
  $ printf "I\nwalked\nin\nthe\nforest\n.\n" | stem

Both the file based input and the input taken from the stdin should be tokenized,
i.e. provide one token per line, tokens should be delimeted e.g. by a new line feed. 

For tokenization consider using a tokenizer, for instance the
{tokenizer}[https://rubygems.org/gems/tokenizer] gem.

== Test Suite

This test is based on the sample input and output text from Martin Porter
website. It includes 23532 test words and their expected stem results.
To run the test, just type

  rake test

== Thanks

Dave Thomas from http://pragprog.com made speed improvements to this code
before it was packaged as a gem.
